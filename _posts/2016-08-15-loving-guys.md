#####   WHEN YOU ARE OLD

------

> When you are old and grey and full of sleep
>
> And nodding by the fire, take down this book
>
> And slowly read, and dream of the soft look`
>
> Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep
>
> How many loved your moments of glad grace
>
> And loved your beauty with love false or true
>
> But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you
>
> And loved the sorrows of your changing face
>
> And bending down beside the glowing bars
>
> Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
>
> And paced upon the mountains overhead
>
> And hid his face amid a crowd of stars
